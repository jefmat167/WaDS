# WaDS (Water Distribution System).
This project is a simple, basic android application that makes it easier for dwellers in an area where access to portable water is rather difficult. 
The app's interface is kept simple and intuitive as the vendors in the area for the app is built are not very much familiar with most of the techs of today. 

The app has a very basic vendors' dashboard on which they can change their availability status (i.e. mark themselves active or inactive) to supply water to whomever needs water urgently.

On the customers' dashboard is a list of all the vendors registered on the along with their phone numbers so that the customer can directly call any vendor they want to. The list also shows if a vendor is available or not.
The app allows customers to place order for water, that vendors can see via their dashboard; it allows customers to complain about vendors, the app admin can view these complaints and sanction the involved vendor(s).

This project users Google Firebase Firestore to the users' details and Firebase Authentication to authenticate the users.
